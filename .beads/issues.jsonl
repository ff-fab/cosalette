MqttPort deliberately excludes lifecycle methods (ISP), but hasattr is not type-safe — if a future adapter accidentally defines a `start` attribute (e.g. a boolean), the code will try to `await mqtt.start()`.\n\n**Decision to evaluate:** Introduce a separate `MqttLifecycle` protocol:\n\n```python\nclass MqttLifecycle(Protocol):\n    async def start(self) -\u003e None: ...\n    async def stop(self) -\u003e None: ...\n```\n\nThen replace `hasattr` checks with `isinstance(mqtt, MqttLifecycle)`.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Keeps MqttPort narrow (ISP)\n- Adds type safety to lifecycle checks\n- MqttClient and MockMqttClient would need to satisfy both MqttPort and MqttLifecycle\n- Could be a union: `MqttPort | MqttLifecycle` or a combined `FullMqttPort(MqttPort, MqttLifecycle)`\n- on_message callback wiring needs its own protocol or stays as hasattr\n\n**Trigger:** Evaluate when building Phase 6 (testing module) or Phase 7 (public API) — whichever introduces additional MQTT adapters or formalises the public API surface.\n\n**References:**\n- _app.py lines 355, 378, 471 (hasattr calls)\n- ADR-006 (hexagonal architecture)\n- PEP 544 (structural subtyping)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"fab@tech-kyb.de","created_at":"2026-02-15T12:16:30.751217415Z","created_by":"Fabian Koerner","updated_at":"2026-02-16T20:12:15.176057582Z","closed_at":"2026-02-16T20:12:15.176057582Z","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["architecture","gate-task"]}
